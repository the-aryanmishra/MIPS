# MIPS Assembler and Processor Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains two primary components:
1. **Assembler**: Converts MIPS assembly code (MARS format) into machine code.
2. **Processor Simulation**: Simulates both pipelined and non-pipelined processors using Python. The processor executes machine code for the bubble sort and factorial algorithms.

## Features
### 1. Assembler
- **Purpose**: Converts MIPS assembly code to machine code.
- **Key Details**:
  - Supports R-type, I-type, J-type, LW/SW instructions.
  - Handles pseudo-instructions (`move`, `bgt`) by translating them into valid MIPS instructions.
  - Performs two-pass assembly:
    - **First Pass**: Collects labels and their memory addresses.
    - **Second Pass**: Converts instructions into machine code.
  - Outputs machine code in a file named `machine_code.txt`.

### 2. Processor Simulation
Simulates execution of the machine code generated by the assembler for the following algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort**: Sorts an array in ascending order.
- **Factorial**: Computes the factorial of a number.

#### Non-Pipelined Processor
- Simulates instruction-by-instruction execution without overlap.
- Executes machine code generated by the assembler.
- Suitable for understanding basic processor behavior.

#### Pipelined Processor
- Implements a 5-stage pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback).
- Handles instruction overlap to improve performance.
- Simulates data hazards, control hazards, and incorporates hazard mitigation techniques.

## Files
- `Assembler.py`: Contains the assembler code to generate machine code from MIPS assembly.
- `non-pipeline.py`: Simulates the non-pipelined processor.
- `pipeline.py`: Simulates the pipelined processor.
- `Assignment Report.pdf`: Documentation of the algorithms and implementation details.

## Usage
### Running the Assembler
1. Prepare your MIPS assembly code in a file (e.g., `mips.txt`).
2. Run the assembler script:
   ```bash
   python Assembler.py
   ```
3. The machine code will be generated in `machine_code.txt`.

### Running the Processors
Place the machine code in a file (e.g., `machine_code.txt`).

Run the desired processor script:

- **Non-Pipelined Processor**:
  ```bash
  python non-pipeline.py
  ```
- **Pipelined Processor**:
  ```bash
  python pipeline.py
  ```

Observe the console output for execution details.

## Implementation Details
### Bubble Sort Algorithm
Sorts an array in ascending order using MIPS assembly.

**Key Steps**:
1. Initialization of variables.
2. Nested loops for comparisons and swaps.
3. Result storage in memory.

### Factorial Computation
Computes the factorial of a number iteratively.

**Key Steps**:
1. Initialize the result to 1.
2. Multiply result with each integer up to the input number.
3. Store the final result in memory.
